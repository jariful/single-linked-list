# single-linked-list
The Program is based on the concept of single linked list. There are 4 classes named after Student, Node, SinglyLinkedList, and StudentMain. So, Node class consists of two datatypes. One is Class variable of Student and another of Node type. In the Student class there are 3 datatypes and 2 methods for storing name, roll number and marks and setting up student details and displaying them too. StudentMain class consists of calling methods which execute various types of tasks like creation of linked list, displaying the linked list, sorting the linked list, etc.
The SinglyLinkedList class is responsible for various operations to be done in the linked list. First of all node is created, and student details are stored. Then the data of the nodes are displayed. There after the topper of the class is displayed as per the mark secured by them. The failed list is also displayed of the students who secured less than 40 marks.  At the last the linked list is sorted and displayed.
